# Used-Vehicle-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This takes in a dataset from an actual and reputed used vehicle selling site in India. We then, use linear regression to try and predict the price of the second hand car by taking its make, model, year of purchase and Kms driven as inputs.

Also, I tried to host it on a local host using Flask (application.py), but now the support has expired.
